#These steps are followed below:
# STEP1 reads the population trends of the species (and subpopulations)
# 
# STEP2 reads the generation length for the species (and subpopulations)
# 
# STEP3 reads the fishing mortality trends of the species (and subpopulations) for understanding of whether a population is sustainably fished and also whether a species, as a whole, is sustainably fished
# 
# STEP4 estimates the total percent population reduction over three generation lengths (or 10 years, whichever is longer) for each subpopulation
# 
# STEP5  applies Criterion A population reductions A1 or A2 thresholds for the determination of the IUCN Red List categories for each subpopulation
# 
# STEP6 calculates the Red List Index of populations (including 52 populations of tunas, billfishes and sharks)
# 
# STEP7 estimates the total percent population reduction over three generation lengths (or 10 years, whichever is longer) for each species by combining the information for all available subpopulations. For those species with multiple populations, we weighted the estimated total percent change in biomass of each population by their maximum sustainable yield to account for the contribution of different population sizes to the global species
# 
# STEP8 applies Criterion A population reductions A1 or A2 thresholds for the determination of the IUCN Red List categories for each species
#
# STEP9 calculates the Red List Index of species (including 18 species of tunas, billfishes and sharks)
