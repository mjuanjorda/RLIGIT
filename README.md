# Seventy years of tuna, billfish and sharks as sentinels of global ocean health


This RedListIndex analysis published in Science develops a robust global indicator (the continuous Red List Index of oceanic predatory fishes) for monitoring ocean health in oceanic marine ecosystems & tracking global sustainability & biodiversity targets.

These files contain the main data sources and RCode for conducting the Red List Index calculation.

Data_raw: We compiled the most recent (as of June 2020) fish stock assessments for 52 populations (18 species) of oceanic tunas, billfishes, and sharks from the five tuna Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs). We limited our data collation to only those assessment models (and runs) that were used by the Scientific Committees of the RFMOs in determining population status and advice (Table 1).
